Learned
-

The students resported learing the following by doing the homework.

- file reading in Javascript and HTML
- how to load a mesh
- Learnt about vertices set and face sets and how the data is stored in a mesh file
- How to apply multiple transformations simultaneously.
- Connect listeners to interactive elements
- the effect that doing transformations on the gpu has on the framerate
- understanding ply files
- working without a "render" button
- to concatenate transformation with their specific order(somewhat). 
- discovered new kind of errors while handling these matrices through which I learned those discoveries."
- Life is hard, and complicated, and it's okay to give up sometimes to take care of yourself.
- changing browser settings.
- building model with just data"
- seeing these transformation matrices in action and knowing their limitations.
- how transformations are applied in 3D softwares.
- using vertex shaders for transformation

Improvement and other feedback
-

The students had the following comments about potential improvement and other aspects of the homework.

- asking us to load a full scene and try navigate in that scene 
- By encouraging the use of high-level web-gl frameworks i.e. three.js.
- If somehow we would know how to give the faces specific colors
- the homework was already well planned, loved it, no significant improvement suggested.
- by providing a ply-reader code
- meshes are messes
